# CRITICAL:
- Menus:
    - Game Intro Menu:
        - Add functional caching.
        - Replace cutscene text with real text.
            - Displaying the asset getting loaded as well as the percentage.
            - Automatic text scrolling.
            - The last part with the logo will still be a cutscene.
- Songs:
    - Digital:
        - Finish the song for the gameplay preview.

# TODO:
- Menus:
    - Gallery Menu:
        - Add images.
    - Main Menu:
        - Clean up the menu options and make the style consistent for the text ones.
        - Finish the enter animations.
        - Add all/Remake current sketches.
    - Options Menu:
        - Add extra offset options in the "Adust Delay and Combo" menu to replace the need for AdvancedOffsets.json.
        - Clean up/add song transitions.
- Systems:
    - Audio:
        - Add custom audio visualizer rendering (Planned to be worked on by ZSolarDev.)

# Extra plans(Extended Scope, hopefully will be added after release):
- Overworld will be a Doom-type area (Via Raycasting.)
